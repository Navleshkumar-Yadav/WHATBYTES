Django Assignment: Building a Healthcare Backend
Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to create a backend system for a healthcare application using Django, Django REST Framework (DRF), and PostgreSQL. The system should allow users to register, log in, and manage patient and doctor records securely.

Requirements:
Use Django and Django REST Framework (DRF) for the backend.
Use PostgreSQL as the database.
Implement JWT authentication for user security using djangorestframework-simplejwt.
Create RESTful API endpoints for managing patients and doctors.
Use Django ORM for database modeling.
Implement error handling and validation.
Use environment variables for sensitive configurations.

APIs to be Implemented:
1. Authentication APIs
POST /api/auth/register/ - Register a new user with name, email, and password.
POST /api/auth/login/ - Log in a user and return a JWT token.
2. Patient Management APIs
POST /api/patients/ - Add a new patient (Authenticated users only).
GET /api/patients/ - Retrieve all patients created by the authenticated user.
GET /api/patients/<id>/ - Get details of a specific patient.
PUT /api/patients/<id>/ - Update patient details.
DELETE /api/patients/<id>/ - Delete a patient record.
3. Doctor Management APIs
POST /api/doctors/ - Add a new doctor (Authenticated users only).
GET /api/doctors/ - Retrieve all doctors.
GET /api/doctors/<id>/ - Get details of a specific doctor.
PUT /api/doctors/<id>/ - Update doctor details.
DELETE /api/doctors/<id>/ - Delete a doctor record.
4. Patient-Doctor Mapping APIs
POST /api/mappings/ - Assign a doctor to a patient.
GET /api/mappings/ - Retrieve all patient-doctor mappings.
GET /api/mappings/<patient_id>/ - Get all doctors assigned to a specific patient.
DELETE /api/mappings/<id>/ - Remove a doctor from a patient.

Instructions:
Set up a Django project with Django REST Framework and PostgreSQL.
Use Django ORM for database interaction.
Implement authentication using JWT with djangorestframework-simplejwt.
Secure patient and doctor-related endpoints with authentication permissions.
Follow best practices for structuring the project.
Test all API endpoints using Postman or an API client.

Expected Outcome:
Users should be able to register and log in.
Authenticated users should be able to add and manage patient and doctor records.
Patients should be able to be assigned to doctors.
Data should be stored securely in PostgreSQL.
Good luck! ðŸš€
